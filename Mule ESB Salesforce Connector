Mule ESB Salesforce Connector

The Salesforce Mule connector establishes connection to Salesforce system using SOAP web service (provided by Salesforce). 
Almost every operation that can be done via the Salesforce’s API can be done thru this connector. 
This connector will also work if your Salesforce objects are customized with additional fields or even you are working with custom objects. 
The Connector supports the option to configure Salesforce connection details, connection pooling and max limit of active connections.
The Salesforce Streaming API is a simple way to push relevant data to your users in real-time, 
instead of having to refresh the screen to get new information. 
This allows a user to get information without having to perform any action to retrieve it, essentially pushing new data to the screen. 
The Streaming API uses a publisher subscriber (pub/sub) model to push data to the client.
The first thing a developer must do is set up a PushTopic in Salesforce. 
This is basically a query that watches for changes in values of certain fields in a Salesforce Object. 
Then the client can subscribe to that PushTopic and receive updates whenever a change is made to the specified fields. 
This is done using a push protocol called the Bayeux protocol. 
The Salesforce implementation uses long polling connections to the server that will be able to notify the client on changes. 
This differs from traditional polling in that it keeps an incoming request open until an event is fired and then sends the response. 
Here’s how this works. An http request is made to the server. Instead of responding immediately, the server keeps the request and waits for a specific event to fire, in our case a change in one of the fields of our PushTopic object. When the event is fired a response is made. Then the client makes another request to the server which it keeps open and waits.
