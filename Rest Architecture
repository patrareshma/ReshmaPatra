nterprise Architecture is the description of the current and/or future structure and behavior of an organization's processes, information systems, personnel and organizational sub-units, aligned with the organization's core goals and strategic direction.

And System Architecture goes down as
A system architecture or systems architecture is the design or set of relations between the parts of a system.

Now this is what I've always thought of as being architecture in an IT context. Even something very very techy like ADML describes software architecture as
A software architecture describes the structural properties of software, typically the components and their interrelationships, and guidelines about their use.
