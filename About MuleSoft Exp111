With the MuleSoft Champions program, sharing lessons learned, tips & tricks, best practices, etc. are rewarded. The program is a
point based system, whereby points are earned by completing a challenge. Challenges include learning more about MuleSoft by reading
a blog or watching a webinar, becoming MuleSoft certified, as well as making contributions to the developer community. Examples of 
the types of contributions are writing a blog post, speaking at an event, or helping someone out with a MuleSoft related question
within a forum.
